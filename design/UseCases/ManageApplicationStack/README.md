# Manage Application Stack
The [Stack Developer](../../Actors/StackDeveloper/README.md) interacts with the
[Application Manager](../../ApplicationManager/README.md) to create new application stacks,
modify application stacks, and remove application stacks. The application stack is a combination
of services that make up a fully funtional application. Or allow for a fully funtion application
to run on the stack. Examples would be LAMP stack, MEAN stack, etc...
